            <li>I am freely donating my volunteer services and have no expectation of receiving and have not been promised compensation or benefits in exchange for any assistance I provide to project owners.</li>
            <li>I am donating my volunteer services to the owner of a tech-for-good project, not to DemocracyLab itself, and any associated liability is entirely with that project owner.</li>
            <li>I release and forever discharge and hold harmless DemocracyLab from any and all liability, claims, and demands related to my volunteering for third-party project owners, use of the DemocracyLab website, and attendance at DemocracyLab events. </li>
            <li>I understand that if I am responsible for injuries or property damage to project owners or others while acting outside the scope of volunteer assignments, that I may be held personally liable by the injured party.</li>
            <li>I will perform the project tasks on a temporary, fully-independent basis without significant and ongoing control of work schedules and conditions by the project owner.</li>
            <li>I am not volunteering for an organization with which I am employed nor am I expecting to receive a job offer from a project owner.</li>
            <li>I will not perform the type of work an employee would typically perform for a project ownerâ€™s customers or clients nor will I supervise employees of a project owner. I will use my own tools and equipment and will not seek reimbursement for any purchases of materials or supplies.</li>
            <li>I grant DemocracyLab permission to use all photographs, images, video, or audio recordings of me in connection with my attendance at DemocracyLab events or volunteering for project owners.</li>
            <li>I am at least 18 years old and possess the authority to bind myself to this agreement.</li>
